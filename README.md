# Mastermind in Ruby
Mastermind is a code-breaking game all about guessing your opponents secret code. Played right in your terminal, you can go head-to-head with the computer either guessing its code or trying your best to stump it with yours.
## Installation
* Install Ruby if you haven't already (instructions [here](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/))
* Navigate to mastermind_ruby folder in terminal
* Run,
```
ruby main.rb
```
## Background
This project was built as part of The Odin Project Ruby course. My goal in making it is to expand my knowledge and hands-on experience with Ruby.
## Lessons Learned
This was one of the most challenging programs I've written. Coding the guessing part of the game was easy. But, things got tricky when I got to the point of coding the AI guesser.
My main problem was trying to develop a simple yet effective strategy for my AI to follow.
I spent multiple hours brainstorming and consulting friends and family about possible solutions.
In the end, the strategy I used was drastically simpler and easier to program than what I expected.
I think this idea stretches far beyond this program.
